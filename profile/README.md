# Stella Maris Governance

### The fixed point.

Stella Maris is the star that doesn't move. In a landscape of shifting cloud costs and fragile security, we provide the bearing. We don't provide opinions; we provide governance. We don't offer promises; we offer evidence.

If you do not know who is in your house, you do not have a house — you have a hallway.

## The Non-Negotiables

- **Evidence over opinion.** If it isn't documented and provable, it doesn't exist.
- **Calm over clever.** Clever is fragile. Calm systems survive audits.
- **Fiscal stewardship.** A dollar wasted is a control weakened. Spend is a root-level security issue.
- **Operator governance.** Built by practitioners for the person defending the system at 0300.

## The Work Library

This organization serves as a public repository of **Governance Packs**. These are not demonstrations; they are deployable, framework-aligned controls.

| Repository | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**identity-iga-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/identity-iga-packs) | Identity Lifecycle, Access Reviews, and Zero Trust Enforcement. |
| [**cloud-security-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/cloud-security-packs) | KQL Detections, Sentinel Rules, and Azure Policy Guardrails. |
| [**finops-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/finops-packs) | Cloud Financial Governance, Spend Transparency, and Tagging. |
| [**readiness-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/readiness-packs) | Evidence collection and control mapping for SOC 2, CMMC, and ISO. |

**Every pack follows the "Expected vs. Observed" Law:**

We document what *should* be true, we prove what *is* true, and we expose the gap. We do not hide from the gap. We close it.
