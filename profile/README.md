## What We Do

We design governance that actually works.

Not dashboards. Not buzzwords. Not one more tool that needs a tool to manage it.

We help organizations **spend less, risk less, and explain themselves better** — without slowing down the mission.

| Practice | What It Solves |
|----------|---------------|
| **Cloud Financial Governance (FinOps)** | Unpredictable cloud spend, no cost accountability, audit exposure |
| **Identity & Access Governance (IGA/IAM)** | Access chaos, orphaned accounts, failed reviews, manual provisioning |
| **Compliance Readiness & Control Design** | Audit stress, paper-only controls, checkbox compliance |
| **Advisory** | Leaders who need answers, not excuses |

---

## How We Think

Four non-negotiables:

**Evidence over opinions.** Every recommendation must be provable.

**Controls before convenience.** Speed without discipline is just expensive chaos.

**Cost is a security issue.** Uncontrolled spend is operational risk.

**Calm systems outperform clever ones.** Boring, well-governed environments win long-term.

*If it can't survive an audit, a budget review, or executive scrutiny, we don't ship it.*

## The Proof

This GitHub is not a portfolio. It's a working library of governance packs — deployable, auditable, framework-aligned.

| Repository | Packs | Domain |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| [`identity-iga-packs`](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/identity-iga-packs) | JML Lifecycle, Access Reviews, Conditional Access, PIM, SoD, Guest vIAM | Identity & Access Governance |
| [`cloud-security-packs`](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/cloud-security-packs) | Sentinel, KQL, Defender, Azure Policy | Cloud Security Operations |
| [`finops-packs`](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/finops-packs) | Cost Governance, Tagging, Budgets, Chargeback | Cloud Financial Governance |
| [`grc-compliance-packs`](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/grc-compliance-packs) | SOC 2, CMMC, ISO, Risk Register | Compliance & Risk |

**Every pack includes:**
- Expected vs Observed assessment — the proof table, not a checklist
- Deployable code (JSON, KQL, PowerShell)
- Framework mapping (NIST 800-53, CIS, CMMC, SOX)
- Operations runbook
- Screenshot evidence guides

## Who We Serve

Small to mid-sized organizations scaling fast. Regulated industries. Government contractors and subcontractors. Nonprofits and mission-driven organizations. Teams that need discipline, not noise.
