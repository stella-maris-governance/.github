## Who We Are

Stella Maris Governance delivers **audit-ready, controls-driven solutions** across Identity & Access Management (IAM/IGA), Cloud Security Posture, and Cloud Financial Operations (FinOps) — with a focus on federal, defense, and regulated environments.

Founded by a **20-year U.S. Navy veteran** (E-6, Retired, 100% P&T) with hands-on experience governing identity programs for 3,500+ personnel, managing $8.7M+ in operational spend, and building inspection-ready compliance programs under DOJ, DOD, and federal audit standards.

## Start Here — Choose Your Path

| You Are | Start With | What You'll Find |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Hiring Manager** | Any pack's `README.md` then `expected-vs-observed.md` | Architecture understanding + proof of implementation. Not theory — tested, evidenced configs. |
| **Consulting Client** | `expected-vs-observed.md` then `/code/` | The gap between "Expected" and your "Observed" is our statement of work. The code is deployment-ready. |
| **Auditor / GRC** | `expected-vs-observed.md` then `control-mapping.md` | Every control mapped to NIST 800-53, CIS, and CMMC with evidence links. Audit-package ready. |
| **Engineer / Builder** | `/code/` then runbook in `/docs/` | Deployable Bicep, JSON, KQL, PowerShell. Every artifact documented with operational procedures. |
| **Community / Peer** | `README.md` — explore freely | Architecture diagrams, cross-pack references, and real-world implementation patterns. |
