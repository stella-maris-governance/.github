# Stella Maris Governance

### The fixed point.

Stella Maris is the star that doesn't move. In a landscape of shifting cloud costs, fragile security perimeters, and vendor ecosystems no one is watching — we provide the bearing.

We don't sell peace of mind. We sell Verified Integrity.

If you do not know who is in your house, you do not have a house — you have a hallway. If you do not know who is in your supply chain, you do not have a supply chain — you have an open door.

## The Three Duties

| Pillar | The Duty | The Discipline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | Duty of Privacy | An identity is an asset. If it's not moving or adding value, it's a liability that must be off-boarded. Inventory control for the digital workforce. |
| **Supply Chain (C-SCRM)** | Duty of Trustworthiness | You don't just vet a vendor's price; you vet their security pedigree. A compromised vendor is a supply chain break — same impact as a factory going dark. |
| **FinOps** | Duty of Fiscal Stewardship | Cloud spend is digital shrinkage. Every zombie resource is waste. Every untagged dollar is unaccountable. Accounting rigor, applied to infrastructure. |

## The Non-Negotiables

- **Evidence over opinion.** If it isn't documented and provable, it doesn't exist.
- **Calm over clever.** Clever is fragile. Calm systems survive audits.
- **Fiscal stewardship.** A dollar wasted is a control weakened. Spend is a root-level security issue.
- **Operator governance.** Built by practitioners for the person defending the system at 0300.

## The Work Library

These are not demonstrations. They are deployable, framework-aligned controls. The work speaks for itself.

| Repository | Pillar | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**identity-iga-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/identity-iga-packs) | Identity | Lifecycle automation, access reviews, conditional access, PIM, SoD, guest governance, SailPoint IIQ, CIEM, threat detection. **9 packs — 90 controls.** |
| [**supply-chain-scrm-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/supply-chain-scrm-packs) | Supply Chain | Vendor risk assessment, NIST 800-161, third-party attestation, Tier 2/3 traceability, SLA governance. |
| [**finops-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/finops-packs) | FinOps | Cost governance, tagging enforcement, budget guardrails, anomaly detection, chargeback. |
| [**cloud-security-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/cloud-security-packs) | Infrastructure | KQL detections, Sentinel rules, Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy. Supporting all three pillars. |
| [**readiness-packs**](https://github.com/stella-maris-governance/readiness-packs) | Compliance | Evidence collection and control mapping for CMMC, SOC 2, and ISO. Cross-cutting. |

**Every pack follows the Law of Evidence:**

We document what *should* be true, we prove what *is* true, and we expose the gap. We do not hide from the gap. We close it.

## The Principal

**Robert Myers, MBA**
*20-Year Navy Veteran · Supply Chain Architect · Mission-Critical Systems & Operations*

BS Accounting · SailPoint ISL · Security+ · CCSK · CC · SC-900 · AZ-900 · FinOps Certified Practitioner

We are not IT consultants. We are Supply Chain Architects who believe that Identity is the new perimeter, FinOps is the new accounting, and your vendor ecosystem is only as trustworthy as the evidence behind it.

This firm is built to outlast its founder. It is structured to be as durable as the star it is named after.

## Who This Is For

| You Are | Start Here |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Defense contractor** | You need CMMC + C-SCRM + Identity in one operating picture. Start with `identity-iga-packs` and `supply-chain-scrm-packs`. |
| **Federal / state agency** | SDVOSB. The work is ready. The clearance path is open. |
| **Regulated industry** | Identity + FinOps. If you're bleeding spend and failing access reviews, the gap is your engagement. |
| **Hiring manager** | Open any pack. Read the Expected vs Observed. That's the interview. |
| **Auditor / GRC** | Control mappings in every pack. NIST 800-53, NIST 800-161, CIS, CMMC, SOX. |
| **Engineer** | Clone the repo. The code deploys. The runbooks operate. |
